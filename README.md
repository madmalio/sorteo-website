## About The Project

![Sorteo App Screenshot](public/sorteo-screenshot.png)
Sorteo was built to solve a common problem: digital clutter. Whether it's a messy "Downloads" folder or a chaotic collection of project files, Sorteo provides an easy-to-use interface to sort your files based on rules you define. Its goal is to turn chaos into order in just a few clicks.

### ## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Flexible Sorting:** Organize files by `Year/Month`, `File Type`, or create your own custom folder structures.
- **Safe Operations:** Perform a **Dry Run** to preview exactly where your files will go before committing to a move or copy.
- **Move or Copy:** Choose to either move files to their new home or simply create an organized copy, leaving the original files untouched.
- **Deep Cleaning:** Optionally include all subfolders in the sorting process for a thorough organization.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, sleek interface built with a customizable dark/light theme.
